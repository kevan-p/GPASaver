Did you ever think you would get so excited to read this section title?\n\nThe [Postman Sandbox](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox) is a JavaScript execution environment that is accessible during pre-request scripts and test scripts. Whatever code you write under the pre-request and test tabs is executed in this sandbox.\n\nAny code that you write under the **Tests** tab in the Postman app will execute after your request. Consequently you have access to the `pm.response` object to make assertions against the actual response -- this is what we call a Postman test.\n\nReview the example tests under the **Tests** tab in the Postman app.\n\n> **Quick tips for syntax**\n- Give each test a descriptive name. When the test fails, this will provide context to the error.\n- Use `pm.response()` as your base assertion where possible to provide more descriptive error messages.\n- Use the optional 2nd parameter in `pm.expect()` to create custom error messages.",

					"description": "The requests in this folder are from a [NodeJS API](https://github.com/auth0-blog/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) that supports username and password authentication with JWTs and has APIs that return Chuck Norris phrases. \n\n---\n\nNaming a collection or folder with `#contract` or `#integration` allows you to programmatically parse the tests that should be run in different circumstances, when used in conjunction with the [Postman API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/).\n\n# Using workspaces for automation\nUse workspaces to organize your services, and also to group together collections of tests that must be passed when deploying new code to the next server environment. Use the [Postman API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/) to fetch a workspace along with all the collections and environments associated with that workspace and create a programmatic solution. \n\nHere's one way the Postman team uses collections and workspaces for automation:\n\n1. Create a collection of validation tests for the provider service. This can include contract validation tests driven by the consumers who are dependent on this service. This can also include integration tests to ensure more complex scenarios involving other components aren't broken when deploying new code.\n2. The name of the collection can include a tag indicating when these tests should be executed (e.g. #contract or #integration). The collection can be shared to the workspace of the provider service. Alternatively, a new workspace can be created (e.g. Continuous Integration) containing all the collections of tests that you care about in the specified circumstances.\n3. Use the [Postman API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/) to `GET` all the collections and environments associated with your workspace. Parse the entities to discern which collections should be run in the specified circumstances.\n\n# Setup and teardown\nNotice the nested folders are organized according to Setup, Tests, and Teardown. Automating the setup and teardown steps allows you to quickly re-create your test conditions in a consistent way so that you can repeat your tests quickly and easily.\n",

Let's see how to do this with an [environment variable](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/intro_to_environments_and_globals).\n\n### Considerations for using variables\nIf you're planning to automate your testing and / or run your test suite as part of your Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, there's some considerations for how you handle your [variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/variables).\n\n![[variable scopes](https://i.imgur.com/cQFnvSZ.png)](https://i.imgur.com/cQFnvSZ.png)\n\n* [Local variables](https://community.getpostman.com/t/the-postman-cheatsheet-quick-reference-guide/1054/7?u=joyce) can be used to save a temporary state within a request and also throughout a collection run. Using a local variable means you won't have to unset the variable during teardown or pollute your namespace.\n* [Environment variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments) are portable and can be used to store server configuration elements. In this way, you can easily swap out the configuration for your staging environment with your production environment when necessary.\n* [Collection variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/variables#defining-collection-variables) are specific to a single collection.\n* [Global variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_globals) are specific to a single workspace. In a personal workspace, your `username` might never change. In a team workspace, you might have dummy user credentials that are shared across the team.\n* [Session variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/sessions) are available for global, collection, and environment variables to maintain variable values within your current session. In this way, you can keep your mutations private and not overwrite any team values.\n\n### Persisting variable values\nVariables can be used to save and update a value throughout a collection run. What if you want to use variables to save state across different runs of the same collection?\n\nSay you want to save the highest ranked player on a leaderboard as an environment value. The behavior of persisting variable values after a collection has been run may differ depending on how you run your collection.\n\n* In the Postman app [collection runner](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collection_runs/intro_to_collection_runs), the default setting is that variables are NOT persisted. That means at the end of a collection run, any variable values that you updated throughout the collection run will be reset to their initial values. There is a checkbox to `Keep variable values` that you can select as an option in the collection runner window before you run the collection.\n* With [Newman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collection_runs/command_line_integration_with_newman) and [Postman monitors](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/monitors/intro_monitors), the default setting is that variables are NOT persisted. In this case, there's no built-in option to persist your values. However, you can use the [Postman API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/) to [update your environment](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/#6517e0d6-3bc3-3da5-ab57-7a578a8504ce), running this request as part of your collection.",

You can define a custom schema, and validate your your server responses against this schema.\n\nOne of the API tests that we previously talked about is validating that the response payloads returned from the server are well-formed. You can do that by making assertions that elements in the response match your expectations. \n\nReview the test written under the **Tests** tab to validate that response payloads returned from the server are well-formed. \n\nThis example uses [Tiny Validator for JSON Schema v4](http://geraintluff.github.io/tv4/). The Postman sandbox offers a built-in tv4 validator to simplify your assertions. Use [json-schema](http://json-schema.org/) [draft v4](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html) to validate simple values and complex objects using a rich [validation vocabulary](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html) ([examples](http://json-schema.org/examples.html)).\n\n",

Using `pm.response()` as your base assertion allows you to receive more specific error messages when debugging. Here are some [`pm.response()` methods](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference#response-assertion-api-in-test-scripts).

Did you ever think you would get so excited to read this section title?\n\nThe [Postman Sandbox](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox) is a JavaScript execution environment that is accessible during pre-request scripts and test scripts. Whatever code you write under the pre-request and test tabs is executed in this sandbox.\n\nAny code that you write under the **Tests** tab in the Postman app will execute after your request. Consequently you have access to the `pm.response` object to make assertions against the actual response -- this is what we call a Postman test.\n\nReview the example tests under the **Tests** tab in the Postman app.\n\n> **Quick tips for syntax**\n- Give each test a descriptive name. When the test fails, this will provide context to the error.\n- Use `pm.response()` as your base assertion where possible to provide more descriptive error messages.\n- Use the optional 2nd parameter in `pm.expect()` to create custom error messages.",
